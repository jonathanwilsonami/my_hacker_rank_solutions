NOTES:
Dictionaries - Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. An unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).

Associative Array/Memory - In computer science, an associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.

Useful Code:
list(d.keys())
sorted(d.keys())
del d['key']
'guido' in d

txt = 'welcome to the jungle'
x = txt.split()
